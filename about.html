  <div class="about-content">
  <p>
   I’m an aspiring software developer with a growing passion for IT and cybersecurity. I enjoy coding and building creative projects using tools like Visual Studio Code and Flutter, where I get to bring ideas to life through apps and clean, functional design. My interests extend into exploring how technology can make everyday life more efficient and secure, from automation to smart device integration. I’m naturally curious and enjoy problem-solving — whether that’s debugging code, learning new programming languages, or experimenting with innovative tools and frameworks. I’m always looking for opportunities to grow my technical skills and challenge myself with projects that combine logic, creativity, and purpose
  </p>
  <p>
    Outside of tech, I’m a big fan of sports like NBA and AFL, and I value being social and working with others in team environments that encourage collaboration and innovation. Whether in sports or software, I thrive in settings where teamwork and shared ideas lead to meaningful results.
