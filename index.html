      Dear Hiring Manager,
    </p>
    <p>
I am writing to express my interest in entry-level opportunities within the Information Technology field, including IT Support, Cyber Security, and Junior Software Development roles. I am currently completing a Certificate IV in Information Technology (Cyber Security) and will soon commence a Bachelor of Information Technology, which reflects my long-term commitment to building a professional career within the industry.
    </p>
    <p>
      Throughout my studies, I have learned to identify emerging technologies, contribute to cyber-security risk management, interpret threat data, and provide first-level help desk support. These skills are supported by practical experience gained through personal projects, including mobile app development, backend system design, and AI-driven tools. I am motivated, detail-oriented, and eager to continue growing within a professional IT team while furthering my education.
    </p>
    <p>
      I’ve also developed a real passion for coding and app development, using tools like Visual Studio Code and Flutter to experiment and create projects
      that blend creativity with technical skill. These experiences have inspired me to continue learning and work toward my long-term goal of becoming a software developer.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before studying IT, I worked in retail, where I learned the importance of teamwork, communication, and reliability.
      I enjoy collaborating with others, solving problems, and finding ways to make technology work better for people.
    </p>
    <p>
      I’m motivated, curious, and ready for the opportunity to apply what I’ve learned in a practical environment, and to keep growing with every challenge that comes my way.
    </p>
    <p>
      Kind Regards,
    </p>
    <p>
      Brandon Elphick
    </p>
